# ev_charging_calculator
Flask-built web application that simulates a time and cost calculator for charging Electric Vehicles.

The project aims to simulate a calculator that calculates the time and cost of charging the battery pack of an Electric Vehicle based on a variety of pre-defined charger configurations and other factors. This repository contains modules that each contribute in implementing the functional requirements of the project. In addition, it also contains testing modules whose test suites contain unit tests designed based on blackbox and whitebox testing strategies. Test suites were developed for each module to properly test their functionality as well as how they handle a variety of inputs. Module coverage of over 90% was achieved by the developed test suites.
